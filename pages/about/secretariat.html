  	<h2>Secretariat Departments</h2>
  	
  	The holdings consist of two main types of archives: 

	<p>Registry files: The first records registry was set up during the London period of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations (between 21 November 1945 and 31 January 1946) and patterned after that of the British Foreign Office. The system was gradually used on less and less records until it was discontinued in 1979, after the decision to move to a decentralized records management system. Function was the centralization of Secretariat recordkeeping in one large classification system. It was succeeded by decentralized recordkeeping by departments in consultation with the Archives Section's records management programme. </p>
	<p>Non-registry records (arranged according to the departmental organisation of the Secretariat, 1946 â€“ present), and include the archives of: </p>
	<p>Office of the Secretary-General, Office of Legal Affairs, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Office of Public Information, Department of Trusteeship and Non-Self Governing Territories, Department of Political and Security Council Affairs, and many others.</p>
