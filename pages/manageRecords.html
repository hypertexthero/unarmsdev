          <div id="electronicText">The United Nations is committed to delivering responsive and accessible services by using information technology.
          Business conducted in the electronic environment needs to be documented appropriately to meet operational, accountability and community requirements. This involves electronic record-keeping, or making and keeping electronic records. Improved electronic record-keeping is essential to the success of the United Nations' goals for information management.
          The following guidance will assist UN Offices to manage electronic records.<br><br>

          <div id="iSensivityText">
            Records and information are important assets of the United Nations, and sound procedures for the protection of the information sensitivity and security are critical for the proper management of the Organizationâ€™s records. Information sensitivity relates to the level of confidentiality of the information within the United Nations.
            The appropriate handling of sensitive information is crucial to the success of the Organization and its operations throughout the world. Information security relates to the protection of the information, including access controls. Information security also ensures that the information is available when needed and that its integrity is maintained, i.e., that it is not altered or inappropriately disclosed.<br><br>
