# Wireframes for UN/ARMS public site

## Things To Do

* Facebook, Twitter, (UN/ARMS Instagram with pok√©mon pictures? :) feeds and 'About UN/ARMS' with a strong image on homepage.
* Consolidate about pages into single or less pages, and finalize other information architecture.
* Find **concepts/pictures/images for each page**
* Update visual design and look and feel with CSS. Look at [Atom.io](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/why-atom/) page for inspiration
* Find out why **404 page template is not working**
* Decided whether and how to implement **local site search** (look at local JS search plugins for jQuery?) - put radio button for now: Search: []This site []UN Archives
* Fix tab fragment navigation on `/records/index.hml` - see http://stackoverflow.com/a/12131590
