	<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
	<h3 id="appointment">Making an Appointment <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>Anyone can access the archives - Secretariat staff, delegations to the United Nations, members of Permanent Missions to the UN and other internal users can consult the archives. External researchers (professors, historians, lawyers, university students, genealogists and the general public) are also welcome to access the archival collections.  </p>

 

	<p>The first step to making an appointment is to have a carefully planned research strategy. The strategy should allow adequate time for background research, establishing which archives hold relevant collections, and include a work schedule which takes into account the extent of the material to be consulted. This includes looking through our [Finding Aids], the [Dag Hammarskjold Library], and our [External Resources] page to understand the records environment of the United Nations. Once you have ascertained that you will need to consult the UN Archives, or have questions about if our records will be relevant to your research, send our reference archivist an [email] to begin a conversation.  </p>

	 

  <p>Some suggestions for making a reference enquiry:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be as specific as possible about your topic. If your research concerns an individual include full name, previous name, dates, places, etc.</li>
<li>Be sure to mention sources already consulted</li>
<li>Please mention any previous contact with staff members</li>
</ul>
	 

	<p>Once you have been in conversation with the reference archivist and have determined that you would like to visit, you will be asked to select your research dates. Be advised that all the desks in our reading room are often booked, and so you must contact the archives in advance to ensure that you will be able to do your research. Booking a desk at least 4-6 weeks in advance is preferred. Especially during the months of April - September, we may not be able to accommodate you on short notice.</p>
	 
	 

	<p>It is advisable to come to the archives with a list of files that you would like to view. The majority of our archival records are held on-site, so there is no need to request them in advance. </p> 

	 

	<p>On the day of your visit, you will need to provide identification such as a driver's license or student card. Please ensure that you have read the [Reading Room Rules and Procedures] before you arrive.</p>
	
	<h3 id="access">Access and Declassification <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>We strive to provide access to as many United Nations records as possible. But, largely for matters of personal and organisational safety, there are a few categories of records which are not open to the public. These include records which are less than 20 years old, records which are classified as “strictly confidential”, or records onto which the Secretary-General has placed access restrictions. Records in poor physical condition, records that have been damaged or unprocessed material (records which have not been arranged and described) are not made available for public consultation. You can read more about those specific policies [here].  </p>
 

	<h4>Access Requests:</h4>
	<p>Records under 20 years old which are not classified may occasionally be accessed on a case-by-case basis, subject to the written consent of the originating office.  </p>
	 

	<h4>Declassification Requests:</h4>
	<p>Declassification opens a classified record for research and reproduction. Records over 20 years old are generally open for public research, unless the classification level "Strictly Confidential" (or related) applies.  
		
		Requests for both access and declassification have to be made in writing (via [email]) to the UN Archives. As decision requires the consent of Secretariat departments, this process can take upwards of a year.  </p>
	 

	<h3><strong>United Nations War Crimes Commission (UNWCC):</strong> <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>

	<p>All archives of the UNWCC are available by application to any person researching the history of the commission or related topics in international law or associated fields. The [finding aid] should be consulted first, as many of the records are open to the public. For “Restricted” records, please read over the [application package] for further details on how to apply for access. The reference archivist can be consulted if you have any questions.  </p>

	 

	<p>Alternatively, you can access all of these records (restricted and unrestricted) at the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum].</p>

	<h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction of Archival Material <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>You are welcome to take notes and/or photographs of any of our materials while you are in our reading room.  </p>

	<p>We are constantly digitising different collections of archival material, based on historical importance and preservation concerns. All of our unclassified, digitised material can be found through the [search engine].  </p>

	<p>If you need a high-resolution scan of the image or document you wish to use, [contact] our reference archivist to discuss options. We are able to provide a small number of scans on an ad-hoc basis, or can arrange with you to reserve a desk in our reading room so that you can make the reproductions yourself. We do not have the resources for large digitisation projects that are not already in our departmental work plan, but are open to discussing partnerships for the planning and funding for these types of initiatives.  </p>

	<p>When we digitise, documents are typically scanned to a resolution of 300 ppi and 1-bit depth black & white mode and saved as a PDF file. For photographs, we scan to a resolution of 300 to 600 ppi and a bit-depth of 8-bit for greyscale images and 24-bit for colour images. Files are saved as either JPEG or TIFF. For more information on these standards, please see our [digitisation guide]. </p>

	<h3 id="use">Using Archival Material <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>Since all of our archives are owned by the United Nations, there are no copyright restrictions on their use. All unclassified records may be used for personal, educational or commercial use without explicit permission from the archives. There are no fees involved in using our materials, but proper citation must be used. </p> 

	<p>If your publisher requires proof of permission to use archival materials, an email exchange using the specific details and language needed can be arranged.  </p>

	<p>Our reading room reference library features publications which have used the UN Archives, so if you would like your publication featured, please [contact] the reference archivist for the address to ship it to. </p>

	<h3 id="citing">Citing Archival Material <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>Precise citations are extremely important so that other people can find the same sources that you have used. Incorrect or incomplete citations are seen by some institutions as a form of plagiary, so please don’t hesitate to contact us if you would like assistance or advice on citing your work.  </p>

 

	<p>The style of citation depends on the preferences of your discipline, instructor, and/or publisher. Information that must be included in any citation of UN archival material is: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Repository: United Nations Archives (can be further abbreviated to UNA after the first mention)</li>
		<li>Reference number: typically, this will look like “S-0123-456-78”</li>
		<li>Title: can be the title of the document, the title of the folder, or the caption of the photo</li>
		<li>Date: the date (or date range) of the document</li>
		<li>Optionally, you can include the title of the folder, series, and fonds to give more specific information.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="items">Allowed and Prohibited Items <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>You may bring the following items with you to use while you research: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pencils and paper/notepads</li>
		<li>Laptops, tablets and cell phones</li>
		<li>Digital cameras</li>
		<li>Hand-held personal scanners</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The following are prohibited:</p> 

	<ul>
		<li>Flatbed scanners, or any type of scanner where the pages must be fed through the scanner</li>
		<li>Food and/or beverages of any type</li>
		<li>Large items such as briefcases, suitcases or coats</li>
		<li>Cell phone conversations, audible music, or other distracting noises</li>
	</ul>
	 

	<p>We provide secure lockers for your personal items, including bags, suitcases, beverages and coats. These items are not allowed to remain at your desk.</p>

	 

	<p>Each desk comes equipped with outlets. You also have access to wi-fi, and can borrow a digital camera if needed.</p>  

	 

	<p>There are camera stands that will assist you with lighting and positioning documents for photographing. </p>

	<h3 id="additional">Additional Accomodations <small class="pull-right"><a href="#top">&uarr; back to top</a></small></h3>
	<p>If you have a physical or hearing disability, are visually handicapped or have special language needs, please contact us before your visit and we will discuss how we can assist with any requirements. We do have an accessible entrance and bathroom and will make every reasonable accommodation so that you may use our reading room in its fullest capacity. </p>
